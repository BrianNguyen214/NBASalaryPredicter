# NBASalaryPredicter

The main purpose of this application was to predict the salary of a some player from the NBA based on their statistics, such as two-point percentage, assist percentage, and field-goal percentage, then compare that predicted salary with their actual salary. It was created using tools from sklearn and numpy. The data came from a csv which is included in this repo.
